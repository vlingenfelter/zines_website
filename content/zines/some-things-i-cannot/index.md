I made this entire zine immediately after getting concussed (and the majority of it was done while waiting for a doctor's appointment to get my head checked). I made this zine while waiting in the Kaiser Hosipital on Broadway in Oakland, and then while sitting at Cafe Chiave on Piedmont Ave. 

I like the 3 interior spreads for this one but I kind of hate the title page and the final page. I used three Prismacolor alcohol based markers, and a few Tombow brush pens, and did this on 65 lb cardstock.
