The day before MLK Day in 2024, I fell really hard while curling and sustained a concussion. I took it really easy for a week, and one of my first outings post concussion was leading a mini-zine making station at a D.I.Y. Museum event in Oakland. While I was there, I made this zine on printer paper using a black sharpie and some sharpie markers.
