Floriography is the practice of communicating through meaning or symbolism ascribed to flowers. I created my own language of flowers to express love, as I feel it, using some of my favorite flowers.

I made this on loose leaf Blick artist paper using three Tombow brush pens and a micron pen (I forget what size but I _believe_ 0.5mm). It is hard to see in the scans, but the flowers are all a deep hot pink and a coral color. It turns out coral is a very challenging color to scan, so the color changed a little bit over the course of reproduction. 

These are scans of individual pages, which are about 4.5 inches by 6 inches (which, I learned, is a TERRIBLE size for scanning and reproducing zines).
