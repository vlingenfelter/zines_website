WARNING! This zine is graphic and contains depictions of body horror. Enter at your own risk. :skull:

This mini zine was made in Oakland, CA in July of 2024 on 65 lb cardstock using Tombow pens and a black sharpie. This zine was made on a day where I got harassed by a strange man, after a series of cases of harassment. I was venting!
