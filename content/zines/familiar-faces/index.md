I wanted to practice getting the character of faces down quickly, soI drew random faces (from the internet, google images, etc) with a black Tombow brush pen, trying to keep each sketch under 60 seconds and refraining from looking at the paper as much as possible. I added accents with a green and red Tombow brush pen, and then tried to imagine what that person would say to me. The drawings were done on Blick loose leaf drawing paper, and then scanned.
