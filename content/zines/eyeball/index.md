WARNING! This zine is graphic and contains depictions of body horror. Enter at your own risk. :skull:

This was the first zine I ever made! I made this at a zine making workshop at Rock Paper Scissors Collective in Oakland, CA. It was made on cardstock with a sharpie and a grey alcohol based marker (from the RPS stash).
