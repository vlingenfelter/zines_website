This was the first zine I made digitially. I made this zine on an IPad Pro with Procreate, using the default brushes (I cannot remember which ones, but probably 6B pencil and the studio pen). I wrote all these poems on my phone in the wee hours of the night on Dec 11, 2023. 

Jabriel, if you ever see this, I love you.
